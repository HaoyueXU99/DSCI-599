## Group Project - Trends in Online Courses: A Data-Driven Analysis of Coursera

### Objective

This project aims to identify and analyze evolving trends in the design of courses and their influence on learner engagement on Coursera from 2021 to 2024. By employing advanced machine learning techniques, including Clustering Analysis and SHAP Analysis, the study seeks to help educators and platforms optimize content to meet changing learner needs effectively.

### Methodology

1. Clustering Analysis: Utilizing TF-IDF vectorization, Truncated SVD, and KMeans clustering to identify patterns in course skills and their evolution over time.

### Key Findings

- Shift from broad academic topics to specialized technical skills, reflecting market demands.
- Prominence of programming skills (e.g., Python) and practical skills related to Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing.
- Importance of course duration, type, and difficulty in influencing learner preferences.

### Application

Developed a personalized course recommendation system using Python and Streamlit, leveraging insights from Cluster Analysis and SHAP Analysis to provide tailored suggestions based on user preferences and data-driven trends. [@Haoyue Xu](https://github.com/HaoyueXU99)
